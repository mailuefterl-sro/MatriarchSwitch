      "description": "This voice-assignment mode uses a cyclical pattern to assign each new note to a different oscillator.

With the value set to On with Reset, the first note played is always assigned to Oscillator 1, and additional notes are assigned to the other remaining oscillators in a rotating fashion. With the value set to On, each note played is assigned to the next available oscillator.\nThe Default is First-Note Reset.",
